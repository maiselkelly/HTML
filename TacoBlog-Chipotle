<h2>Chipotle</h2>

<b>Burritos</b>
<blockquote>No matter how healthy you keep your burrito fillings, there’s no way to shake off the salt. Why? The tortilla itself is packed with 690 mg of sodium — just under a half a day’s recommended intake.</blockquote>
<b>Bowls</b>
<blockquote> It has all the flavors of a classic burrito for a fraction of the calories and salt. Add a protein, a carb and a healthy fat to keep your meal lean and nutritionally balanced. Rules of thumb: Pick a rice or a bean, because they both provide carbs. Choose just one fatty add-in such as guac, cheese or sour cream. We opted for the guac, because it's rich in monounsaturated and oleic fatty acids, which have been shown to spot-reduce abdominal fat. </blockquote>
<b>Tacos</b>
<blockquote>The first decision you need to make when you order tacos is the tortilla. Chipotle offers three options: crispy corn, soft corn and soft flour. You already know the soft flour tortilla is loaded with salt, calories and fat. So let’s focus on the crispy corn and the soft corn tortillas: Both have 210 calories, 30 milligrams of sodium, 3 grams of protein and 6 grams of fiber, and their carbs vary by just 5 grams. However, soft corn tortillas contain no fat, while both the soft flour tortillas and crispy corn tortillas have 7.5 grams (3 grams saturated). Go for the soft corn tortillas, and save the fat and sodium for fillings!.</blockquote>
